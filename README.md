# CourseEnrollment

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.1.0.

For this project to work as well, you must run `npm use` and then `npm install`.

## Development server

Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `npm build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Tests and refactoring

I was only able to work on this test on Monday (evening/night), Tuesday (evening) and Wednesday. But always after working time, so I couldn't handle to do the
tests and the code refactoring before the deadline. But the application seems to be working well!
